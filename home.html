	<p>Once you choose your gender, you can start selecting your body shape
	   and then simulate verious clothing.
	   Any piece you select has multiple sizes, which you can switch between.
	   You can also choose the color, by giving the RGB input.
	   If you can see holes in your chosen clothing, we can assume it doesn't
	   fit the model and you should adjust the size.</p>
	<h3>Material</h3>
	   <p>
	   First you should start a simulation with stiff material, which 
	   tries to keep the shape of original model. If the cloth piece 
	   does not adapt well enough to the body shape, you will want to try
	   use the soft material. Soft material can also be used, not only
	   for better adaptation, but just different behaviour under gravity.
	   Also if pants waist does not hug the body well enough, you should 
	   switch to soft material for better adaptation.</p>
	   <p><b>WARNING:</b> soft material can cause model shape to deform.</p>
